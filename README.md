**Performance Showdown: 🚀 Simple Python vs. Numba-Optimized**

In this electrifying duel, the clock is ticking as we pit the contenders against each other in a high-stakes battle of computation speed.

🔴 **sum_of_squares_python (10 sec):** In the red corner, the battle-tested `sum_of_squares_python` takes the stage, armed with simplicity and clarity. This Python function gracefully computes the sum of squares from 1 to N. 🕰️💡

🔵 **sum_of_squares_numba (0.5 sec):** Stepping boldly into the blue corner is the lightning-fast `sum_of_squares_numba`. Empowered by Numba's JIT compilation, this contender slashes computation time to a mere 0.5 seconds. ⚡🚀

As we witness the swift execution times, the advantage leans decisively towards the Numba-optimized approach. The numbers don't lie, highlighting the remarkable efficiency gains achievable with Numba in the realm of numerical computations. 📊🏁

The winner emerges, and it's clear that in this race against the clock, Numba takes the lead with unparalleled speed and computational prowess. 🏆👏
